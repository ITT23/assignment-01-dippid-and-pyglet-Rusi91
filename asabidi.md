## Ruslan Asabidi (13/15P)

### 1 DIPPID Sender (4.5/5P)

 * accelerometer values are completely random (applying a sine function does not change that) **(-0.5)**

### 2 2D Game (8.5/10P)

 * game implementation
   * all requirements fulfilled
 * DIPPID input
   * works
 * code quality
   * don't use Windows-only paths (with double backslash) - using a library such as os.path is best practice
   * a lot of global variables - please use classes next time **(-1)**
 * interaction technique
   * very slow without several speed boosts, but ok
   * good idea restarting the game by flipping the phone
 * look of the game
   * bright boxes on a black background - it wouldn't have been that much work to use like a star background or nice space ship images, right? **(-0.5)**
 * venv
   * fine
